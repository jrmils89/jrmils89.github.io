        <p>Hi there! I'm a full stack developer based in NYC</p>
        <p>Currently I work on the <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.hbloom.com/">H.Bloom</a> platform as part of the From You Flowers network. I like it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I regularly use things like Java, Scala, Spring, Play! Framwork, & Angular. However, I often dabble in other things like Ruby/Rails, Node/Express, & React.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Development topics that tend to interest me are things like object oriented best practices, generics, functional programming, and how/when to automate tasks (sadly our coffee machine is
          <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/249-now-thats-what-i-call-a-hacker/">not on the network</a>) ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>In my previous life, I worked for 2 professional baseball teams (Miami and Tampa Bay) and was a Product Manager at Bloomberg Sports through it's acquisition by STATS LLC.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="small-font">Please note, if you're interested in contacting me regarding potential work I'm always open to chatting but I'm happy where I am right now and will only engage if you provide me some details about the company's product and it doesn't seem like a form letter. Sorry!</p>
