      <p>Hi there! 😁</p>
      <p>Welcome to my webpage, home of very little! My name is Jesse Mills, I'm a software developer based in the NYC
        area.</p>
      <p>I write code primarily in Java, Scala, and Javascript, but dabble in Ruby & C# as well. These days I am
        the Development Team Lead for <a href="https://www.hbloom.com">H.Bloom</a>, leading their efforts
        around floral and plant orders. 🌸🌹💐🌸💐🌹🌸
      </p>
      <p>Prior to my current role, I was the product manager for a sports technology company called BSports, which was
        originally part
        of Bloomberg LP, before it was eventually acquired by STATS LLC. In that role I led efforts around our line
        of baseball products targeting MLB, international, and media clients.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to my professional roles, I serve on the immigrant youth ally board for <a href="http://www.atlasdiy.org/">Atlas:DIY</a>
        a non-profit based in Sunset Park, Brooklyn which supports immigrant youth empowerment. Check them out they do
        really valuable and important work!</p>
      <p>I also worked as a TA for General Assembly, participated in the
        <a href="https://www.civichalllabs.org/probonotech">Civic Hall Labs Pro Bono Tech</a>
        program, volunteered my time for an
        <a href="http://www.nynice.org/">immigrant service center</a> in Queens, and prior to moving to NYC
        worked for the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays</p>
