    <p>I'm a software developer based in the NYC area.</p>
    <p>I write code primarily in Java, Scala, and Javascript, but dabble in Ruby &amp; C# as well. These days I am
      the Development Team Lead for <a href="https://www.hbloom.com">H.Bloom</a>, leading their efforts
      around floral and plant orders
    </p>
    <p>Prior to my current role, I was the product manager for a sports technology company called BSports, which was
      originally part
      of Bloomberg LP, before it was eventually acquired by STATS LLC. In that role I led efforts around our line
      of baseball products targeting MLB, international, and media clients.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to my professional roles, I serve on the immigrant youth ally board for <a href="http://www.atlasdiy.org/">Atlas:DIY</a>
      a non-profit based in Sunset Park, Brooklyn which supports immigrant youth empowerment. Check them out they do
      really valuable and important work!</p>
    <p>I also worked as a TA for General Assembly, participated in the
      <a href="https://www.civichalllabs.org/probonotech">Civic Hall Labs Pro Bono Tech</a>
      program, volunteered my time for an
      <a href="http://www.nynice.org/">immigrant service center</a> in Queens, and prior to moving to NYC
      worked for the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays</p>
      
      <p>I also dabble in photography as a hobby. Click the photo or instagram icons above to see some of my work!</p>
