            <p>Hi there! I'm a full stack developer based in NYC. Currently I work on the <a href="https://www.hbloom.com/">H.Bloom</a> platform as part of the From You Flowers network. I like it.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I regularly use things like Java, Scala, Spring, Play! Framework, & Angular. However, I often dabble in other things like Ruby/Rails, Node/Express, & React.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Development topics that tend to interest me are things like functional programing, good application design, front end trends/best practices, and automation (sadly the office coffee machine is
                <a href="https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/249-now-thats-what-i-call-a-hacker/">not on the network</a>) ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I've been focused on coding full time for about a year and a half now (as of Feb 2017), but I have nearly 5 years of experience in tech as I was previously
                a product manager for Bloomberg Sports through it's acquisition by STATS LLC.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Outside of development I enjoy watching basketball and traveling. I've lived in Spain during High School and have lived in 5 different states.
                And while I haven't had as much time recently, I enjoy volunteering my time to the community when I can. You can read an article about causes I'm interested in <a href="http://qns.com/story/2015/02/09/star-of-queens-jesse-mills-volunteer-new-immigrant-community-empowerment/"> here.</a> I also ocassionally go the gym, begrudgingly, when I can find the motivation.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>If you're interested in seeing some of my work, I mostly check in work professionally these days. But you can check out some of my older
                work via my "portfolio" <a href="/portfolio">here</a>
