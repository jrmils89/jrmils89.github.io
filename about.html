    <h1>Some Fun Facts About Me!</h1>
    <li>I grew up in Rhode Island, but I also lived for a year in Spain during high school</li>
    <li>I interned for two professional baseball teams after college (Tampa Bay Rays & Miami Marlins)</li>
    <li>I speak fluent Spanish. In fact, my mom is an immigration lawyer who speaks better Spanish than I do, my dad is Salvadoran, and my step-dad is Cuban. I might actually be the worst Spanish speaker of the bunch...</li>
    <li>I studied Spanish Literature in college, with minors in Applied Ethics (Philosophy) and Sociology. Thankfully they help me think critically because they clearly don't bring in the big bucks...</li>
    <li>Oh, I also graduated a semester early from college while also working and traveling with the university baseball team. You may have seen my alma mater recently on Sportscenter doing <a href="http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2016/02/23/165288082/george-washington-university-jousts-during-rain-delay">this</a> </li>
    <li>My tech career started when I moved to NYC to work for then Bloomberg Sports (now STATS LLC) at first as an analyst and eventually Product Manager. Some of the products I worked on can be found <a href="http://www.stats.com/pro-team-solutions/">here</a></li>
    <li>Until recently, I spent some of my free time volunteering at <a href="http://www.nynice.org">NICE</a>, a community non-profit in Jackson Heights that primarily serves its immigrant community. There was actually an embarrasingly nice article written about me which can be found <a href="http://qns.com/story/2015/02/09/star-of-queens-jesse-mills-volunteer-new-immigrant-community-empowerment/">online...</a></li>
